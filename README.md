Tool Crib is program to help businesses manage their tools, assets, and supllies that are shared among associates of the company. The system gives the ability to maintain a database of the company's equipment. It also assigns temporary ownership of items to individuals by forcing check-out and check-in requirments to track and log tool usage.

The first thing you want to do is open the 'Manage Tools' window. From there you can add tools to the database one at a time or import from a template. The template should have the headers 'ID', 'Tool Name' and, 'Serial Number'.
Then you should do the same for employees using the 'Manage People' window.
Tools can be checked out in the 'Check out' window and checked back in using the 'Check In' window.
At any time a list of what tools are signed out to whom can be view in the 'Out List' window. A text file can be downloaded for record keeping or following up overdue items.
Record storage is persistent and the app can be continued if it is restarted.
